    "text": "Introduction on Redesign Project\nThis project examines two visualizations representing the percentage of American youth ages 17-24 who are ineligible for military service. The initial visualization analyzed was obtained from the White House MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Report [1]. The first original graph, while a simple pie chart, it contains several limitations in clarity, readability, and analytical values. Consequently, I sought to redesign and enhance the visualization to improve its interpretability and adherence the effective data visualization principle.\nTo locate the underlying data, I reviewed the report’s cited sources which references the Joint Advertising, Market Research & Studies (JAMRS) program. However, many of the reference links were inactive or no longer accessible. One reference led to StrongNation.org [2] where I identified a related visualization that served as the basis for a secondary redesign within this project.\nBecause the original dataset could not be retrieved, I manually reconstructed the data using numerical values extracted directly from the published graphics. The recreated dataset was then analyzed and visualization redesigned. This process enabled the development of new, data-driven visualizations that more effectively convey the underlying patterns and improve upon the design and interpretive shortcomings of the original charts.\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\nSources Information\n[1] JAMRS, 2020 Youth Report (as cited in The White House – MAHA Report, May 22, 2025). https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf \n[2] Department of Defense (2017), as cited by Mission: Readiness – Council for a Strong America.

    "text": "Hello, I hope you enjoyed this project!\n\nMy name is Veronica Wood.\nI earned a B.S. in Business Management from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 2019, and I’m excited to begin my first graduate degree with a MS in Data Analytics Engineering program.\nI have always been interested by the stories that data can tell and how those insights can drive meaningful improvement. My interest grew further during my role as a Budget Analyst for the Department of Defense, where I provide analysis across multiple financial portfolios.\nI believe that pursuing the MS DAEN degree will provide me with a more well-rounded foundation in data analysis and position me for continued growth in the field."
