    "text": "Introduction on Redesign Project\nThis project examines two visualizations representing the percentage of American youth ages 17-24 who are ineligible for military service. The initial visualization analyzed was obtained from the White House MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Report [1]. The first original graph, while a simple pie chart, it contains several limitations in clarity, readability, and analytical values. Consequently, I sought to redesign and enhance the visualization to improve its interpretability and adherence the effective data visualization principle.\nTo locate the underlying data, I reviewed the report’s cited sources which references the Joint Advertising, Market Research & Studies (JAMRS) program. However, many of the reference links were inactive or no longer accessible. One reference led to StrongNation.org [2] where I identified a related visualization that served as the basis for a secondary redesign within this project.\nBecause the original dataset could not be retrieved, I manually reconstructed the data using numerical values extracted directly from the published graphics. The recreated dataset was then analyzed and visualization redesigned. This process enabled the development of new, data-driven visualizations that more effectively convey the underlying patterns and improve upon the design and interpretive shortcomings of the original charts.\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\nSources Information\n[1] JAMRS, 2020 Youth Report (as cited in The White House – MAHA Report, May 22, 2025). https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf \n[2] Department of Defense (2017), as cited by Mission: Readiness – Council for a Strong America.

My interest grew further during my role as a Budget Analyst for the Department of Defense, where I provide analysis across multiple financial portfolios.\nI believe that pursuing the MS DAEN degree will provide me with a more well-rounded foundation in data analysis and position me for continued growth in the field."

Resign emphasized proportional understanding of the data. This redesign aimed to create a direct comparison between eligibility categories while retaining all key original data points.\nThis redesign makes it clear that nearly half of youth (44%) are ineligible due to multiple disqualifying factors. It also highlights that overweight and drug use are key single-factor disqualifies. The redesign graph conveys the same information from the original but is visually cleaner and focused.\n\nImprovements\n\nSwitched from a pie chart to a horizontal bar chart to improve comparison.\nGrouped the data logically by placing “Meet All Criteria” at bottom.\nUsed color coding to separate “eligible” and “Ineligible” for immediate visual contrast.\nRenamed labels for clarity and added clear title, axis labels, and percentages."

To allow for proportional scaling I updated by population count given in the original graph of 32,878,937 youth.\nWhile this graph changed the original focus from comparing the proportion of eligible verses ineligible youth, I felt that this design better communicated the magnitude of disqualification by type. It shows that “Multiple Disqualifiers” vastly outweighs other categories. The simplified focus helps clarify both scale and impact.\n\nImprovements\n\nConverted percentages to actual population count (in millions).\nSimplified the chart to focus only on disqualifying factors.\nGrouped 1% categories into an “Other (≤1%)” segment with a clear footnote.\nRefined color gradient to represent severity."
