### Introduction on Redesign Project

This project examines two visualizations representing the percentage of American youth ages 17-24 who are ineligible for military service. The initial visualization analyzed was obtained from the White House MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Report [1]. The first original graph, while a simple pie chart, it contains several limitations in clarity, readability, and analytical values. Consequently, I sought to redesign and enhance the visualization to improve its interpretability and adherence the effective data visualization principle. 

To locate the underlying data, I reviewed the report’s cited sources which references the Joint Advertising, Market Research & Studies (JAMRS) program. However, many of the reference links were inactive or no longer accessible. One reference led to StrongNation.org [2] where I identified a related visualization that served as the basis for a secondary redesign within this project.

Because the original dataset could not be retrieved, I manually reconstructed the data using numerical values extracted directly from the published graphics. The recreated dataset was then analyzed and visualization redesigned. This process enabled the development of new, data-driven visualizations that more effectively convey the underlying patterns and improve upon the design and interpretive shortcomings of the original charts.
